Screambot just freaks out about everything all the time, on slack.

# running screambot

## Create a slackbot in your workspace.
* Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create new app.

* Give it a name and a background colour.

* Go to OAuth and Permissions" and give it the "post to specific channels in Slack" and "Add a bot user" scopes.

* Go to Bot Users and add a bot user.

* Go to OAuth and Permissions and Install App to Workspace. This generates access tokens. 

## Set up a server to run it on
I use the smallest size of GCE VM. Any server will do so long as slack can get to it.

## Get the code working
* Install the slackclient module. On ubuntu that's:  

`sudo apt-get install python-pip`  
`sudo pip install slackclient`

* Grab the Bot User OAuth Access Token from the OAuth and Permissions tab for your app on https://api.slack.com/apps. Put it in a file called secret.py, like
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-your-access-token"

* Copy down the code. To run the tests, install python-pytest  
`sudo apt-get install python-pytest`

and run

`$ py.test test_screambot.py`

## Optional: Change the logging
It's currently set up to log to Google Cloud Logging. Comment out those parts if you
aren't on GCE, or don't want to deal with it. If you want it, get the library with
`pip install google-cloud-logging`, enable the Cloud Logging API in the cloud console, and add
the "cloud platform" api scope for the GCE instance.

## Configure systemd to keep the bot running.

There's a systemd config at config/screambot.service 

Change the directory in WorkingDirectory= and ExecStart= to point at wherever the code is.

Drop it at `/etc/systemd/system/screambot.service` and enable it to start at boot with
`systemctl enable screambot`. It logs to regular syslog so grep for
screambot in /var/log/daemon.log or equivalent.

You can start/stop it with `systemctl start`, `systemctl stop`, etc.
